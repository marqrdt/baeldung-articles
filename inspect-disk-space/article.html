<h2>1.1 Inspecting Disk Usage on a Linux System</h2>

<h3>1.2 Objective and Overview</h3>
<p>
    In this article, we'll learn some ways to inspect the file storage usage on a Linux system.
    We'll also learn some techniques for drilling down into directories to inspect how much space each directory is consuming.
    This article assumes some experience with running commands in the Bash shell and should apply to both Debian and CentOS-based systems.
    These commands will work on both a local desktop system or a remote session to another machine.
</p>

<h3>1.2.2 Naming conventions</h3>

<p>
    We'll use the term "disk" throughout this article to refer to a storage device for data we want to preserve over time.
    In modern computing hardware, most physical storage devices are neither disk-shaped or operate by retrieving bits from a
    spinning plate. In addition, many systems use network-based "disks" which hide the hardware technology from the end user.
    We'll keep things short using the term "disk" is shorter than "storage device".
</p>

<h3>1.3 Undestanding Basic Disk Layout</h3>
<p>
    It's important to understand the basic disk layout of our system. Linux OSes organize their storage into filesystems.
    A filesystem is a top-level mapping of a storage device (disk, partition or logical volume) onto a directory name.
    We'll use the <strong>df -h</strong> command to both see our disk layout and the basic usage for each filesystem:
</p>
    <code>
        someuser@somehost:~$ df -h
        Filesystem Size Used Avail Use% Mounted on
        tmpfs 6.3G 4.7M 6.3G 1% /run
        /dev/mapper/vgubuntu-root 456G 263G 170G 61% /
        tmpfs 32G 234M 32G 1% /dev/shm
        tmpfs 5.0M 4.0K 5.0M 1% /run/lock
        tmpfs 32G 0 32G 0% /run/qemu
        /dev/nvme0n1p2 705M 254M 401M 39% /boot
        /dev/nvme0n1p1 511M 5.3M 506M 2% /boot/efi
        /dev/mapper/vg_data_02-lv_data_02 916G 586G 284G 68% /mo-data-02
        /dev/mapper/data_vol_01 457G 177G 257G 41% /mo-data-01
    </code>

    <p>
        Thee <strong>lsblk</strong> command provides us similar information, but also displays a nicely-formatted device trees
        to give an idea of how filesystems are laid out within a disk device. On an Ubuntu system, we might want to pipe the output
        through <strong>grep -v "^loop[0-9]+"</strong> to filter out the display of installed <strong>snaps</strong>,
        which appear as a filesystem node:

<h3>Analyzing disk usage for single directories</h3>
<p>
    We'll be drilling into our home directory (/home/someuser) to see home much space each directory is consuming.
    And the results might be surprising. Looking at the output above from df -h, we notice that there is no listing for
    /home/{username}, which indicates that it exists inside of one of the filesystems listed, /, or the <strong>root</strong> filesystem in this case. 
    First we'll run the cd command with no arguments to change into our home directory, then we'll run ls -la to list the contents:
</p>
    <code>
        someuser@somehost:~$ cd
        someuser@somehost:~$ ls -la

    </p>
<p>
    The flags <strong>-ls</strong> instruct the <strong>ls</strong> command to output a <strong>l</strong>ong listing, showing columns for
    the permissions and file type, the number of subdirectories, the user and group owner, the size of the directory listing 
    (we'll see later that is is NOT the amount of space directory consumes), the modification date and time and finally, the directory name.
</p>
<p>
    From our home directory, we'll run the command <strong>du -sh</strong>. This command is similar to <strong>df</strong> and 
    displays the amount of space a directory consumes. We add the <strong>-sh</strong> option string is actually two options squeezed together.
    The -s option displays a summary of the top directory. Without it, <strong>du</strong> would descend into each subdirectory, 
    which, in many Linux home directories, can number in the 1000's and not very useful here.
    The <strong>-h</strong> option displays the output in <strong>h</strong>uman-readable form, which lists output as **G**igabytes, **M**egabytes, etc.
    The trailing dot indicates the name of the directory to inspect, which is the current directory (/home/someuser).
    The output below shows that my home directory is using 221G of disk space:
</p>

<code>
    someuser@somehost:~$ du -sh .
    221G    .
